<h2>The Problem</h2>It's been almost two months now, since i've been feeling that i'm not getting enough time to write anything. The first year of college ended and with it, it took the course of English-1 and 2. Sure, humanity courses are a chore and not really important but frankly speaking that was the only place that i could write stuff. Whatever i wanted. Since then it's just been hundred's of Research Papers, Quora and Medium Posts but no writing. I did start writing Quora Answers(..Seriously Quora as a medium is the best place today. With answers ranging from evrything to everything.) but i guess the only answers that kept coming up on my feed were on India, and the whole religious problems and politics and IIT's and stuff. Questions like these become quite daunting and irritating after some time and hence i gave up on writing alltogther.<br><h2>The Solution</h2>Anyways, the only thing i realised that i have to start writing again, maybe irregularly, somewhat crude but still something. Not for anyone, NO. Just to read it myself because when you write what you write you finally realise that what you wrote was pure Crap.<br>Now came the time to turn this into a programming assignment.<h2>The Process</h2>I started with thinking that i could go with a javascript approach(..Atwoods Law, and what not.) and use individual text files to make up an html file each time. Now i am a fan of GitHub. I Love It. The Simplicity and awesomeness, just WoW.!! So, i was thinking of GitHub pages to run my javscript code as my <a href="ankit-vadehra.co.nr">original site</a> is also on GitHub. But GitHub only has static page postig and does not allow any dynamic content at run time, so my plan went on a hold. Anyways, i finally realised that it would be better to design a skeleton of the blog link it and automate the posting proess usig Shell. Now shell is a fast, small and really powerfull tool, and using it i wrote CaffeinePost. 5-6 Hours later and boom!! I had a static blog generator. Now it's just a matter of writing posts and to add a CSS script that can handle code snippets properly.<br> Adios,<br>Ankit Vadehra.

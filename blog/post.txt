For so long i've wanted to download all of the <a href="http://phdcomics.com/comics.php"> PHDComics</a> webcomics. For those of you who don't know what it is, PHDComics are a series of web comics by Jorge Cham that depict the common idiosyncrasies of Graduate School and the Grad Student's life. They are pretty Hilarious. :D<br> Anyways, so i finally sat to write a simple script that could download all of the comics for me. Sounds simple right? A simple loop, culr/wget and presto, all images downloaded. Nopes.!! Took me a good 1 Hour and 15 minutes to figure stuff out and write it down.<h2>The Problem</h2>I'm not sure why or how, but, the PHDComics web servers have somehow banned the normal tools like: "wget", "curl/libcurl", "lynx" etc from accessing their servers. They just send realy awesome 403-Errors. So, it seemed that Python was the only way to go. Python with "urllib" and "BeautifulSoup" would have easily scraped everything in no time. But, 15 minutes in and i realised that there's this tool called <b><a href="http://w3m.sourceforge.net/" > w3m </a></b> which is a terminal browser like lynx, and while it's not that popular, it is capable of dumping the source code of a website, which is cool..
